# User Story: 27 - Driver Trip Status Updates

**As a** driver,
**I want** to update trip status throughout the journey (pickup, in-transit, completed),
**so that** customers are informed of progress and the platform can track trip lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Trip status buttons: "Arrived at Pickup", "Passenger Picked Up", "Trip Completed"
* Status updates automatically notify customer with timestamps
* GPS location automatically recorded with each status change
* Photo verification option for pickup and dropoff locations
* Customer signature or confirmation for trip completion
* Trip completion triggers payment processing and earnings calculation

## Notes

* Essential for trip lifecycle management and customer communication
* Status updates enable accurate billing and payment processing
* Photo verification provides dispute resolution evidence
