# User Story: 26 - Driver Availability Status Management

**As a** driver,
**I want** to control my online/offline status and set availability preferences,
**so that** I only receive trip requests when I'm ready to drive and in my preferred service area.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Online/offline status toggle prominently available in driver app
* Service area radius selection (5km, 10km, 15km options)
* Break time scheduling to pause trip requests temporarily
* Vehicle capacity settings (number of passengers, luggage space)
* Automatic offline status after period of inactivity
* Trip type preferences (private, shared, long-distance)

## Notes

* Allows drivers to manage their working schedule effectively
* Service area preferences optimize trip matching
* Break time feature prevents unwanted interruptions
* Vehicle capacity helps match appropriate trips to driver capabilities
