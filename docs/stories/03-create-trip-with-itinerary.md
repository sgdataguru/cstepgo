# User Story: 3 - Create Trip with Itinerary

**As a** driver/trip organizer,
**I want** to create trips with detailed day-by-day itineraries,
**so that** potential passengers can see exactly what activities are planned.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Block-based itinerary builder in trip creation flow
* Can add multiple activities per day
* Can reorder activities via drag-and-drop or move buttons
* Each activity includes fields for time, location, description
* Preview shows how itinerary will appear to users
* Itinerary saves as structured JSON in database

## Notes

* Simple interface needed for non-technical users
* Consider adding templates for common trip types
