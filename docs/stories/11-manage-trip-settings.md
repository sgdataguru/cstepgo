# User Story: 11 - Manage Trip Settings

**As a** platform administrator,
**I want** to configure trip-related settings through an admin panel,
**so that** I can control platform behavior without code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Admin settings page includes:
  - Toggle for auto-publishing trips
  - Route to hero image mapping interface
  - Pricing coefficient update table
  - Country restriction list for autocomplete
* Changes take effect immediately
* Settings have validation to prevent errors
* Audit log of setting changes
* Role-based access control

## Notes

* Critical for operational flexibility
* Consider adding bulk trip management features
