# User Story: 21 - Driver Trip Discovery

**As a** driver,
**I want** to view all available customer trip requests in my area,
**so that** I can choose which trips to accept and participate in the platform economy.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Driver dashboard displays list of available trips within configurable radius
* Trip cards show pickup location, destination, payment amount, and distance
* Real-time updates when new trips become available
* Trip filtering options by distance, time, and payment amount
* Trip details include customer information and special requirements
* Trips automatically remove from list when accepted by another driver

## Notes

* This is the core missing functionality that prevents drivers from seeing customer requests
* Similar to Uber/Grab trip discovery interface
* Requires real-time updates and proximity-based filtering
* Should show estimated earnings per trip
