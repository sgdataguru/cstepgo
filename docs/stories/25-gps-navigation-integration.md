# User Story: 25 - GPS Navigation Integration

**As a** driver,
**I want** integrated GPS navigation to customer pickup and destination locations,
**so that** I can efficiently navigate to trip locations without switching between apps.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Turn-by-turn navigation to pickup location after accepting trip
* Automatic switch to destination navigation after customer pickup
* Real-time traffic updates and route optimization
* Offline maps support for poor network coverage areas
* Integration with popular navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze) as fallback
* ETA updates shared with customer automatically

## Notes

* Critical for mobile-first driver experience
* Should work seamlessly with phone's GPS and navigation capabilities
* Need to handle poor network connectivity gracefully
* ETA sharing improves customer experience and reduces anxiety
