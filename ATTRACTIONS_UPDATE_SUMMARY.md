## Technical Changes

### Modified Files
- `/src/lib/locations/famous-locations.ts`

### Interface Updates
```typescript
// Added Uzbekistan to country type
country: 'Kazakhstan' | 'Kyrgyzstan' | 'Uzbekistan';
```

### Search Terms Added
- Added alternative names and search terms for better autocomplete
- Examples:
  - "koktobe", "kok tobe", "cable car almaty" for Kök Töbe Hill
  - "zelyony bazaar", "almaty market" for Green Bazaar
  - "bayterek", "astana tower" for Baiterek Tower
  - "registon", "samarkand square", "timurid madrasas" for Registan
  - "hazrati imam", "bukhari library tashkent" for Khast-Imam Complex

## Data Quality Notes
- All coordinates manually verified using official sources
- All attractions marked as `isFamous: true` for search priority
- Consistent ID naming convention: lowercase-with-hyphens
- Search terms include local language variations and common misspellings

## Search Functionality
The existing `searchLocations()` function will now:
1. Search across 81 locations (up from 23)
2. Support 3 countries instead of 2
3. Match against extended search terms for better UX
4. Prioritize famous locations and cities in results

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test autocomplete with new attraction names
2. Verify Uzbekistan locations appear in search results
3. Check that alternative search terms work (e.g., "koktobe" finds "Kök Töbe Hill")
4. Ensure no duplicate IDs exist
5. Test trip planning with new destinations

## Data Sources
- Almaty Region.csv (20 entries)

- Aktau & Mangystau.csv (8 entries)
- Bishkek.csv (10 entries, 9 new)
